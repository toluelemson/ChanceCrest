## Endpoints Overview

### 1. Place a Bet

#### REST Endpoint

- **URL**: `/play`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "betAmount": 40.5,
    "playerNumber": 50
  }
  ```

#### WebSocket Endpoint

- **Destination**: `/app/play`
- **Broadcast Topic**: `/topic/play`

### 2. Simulate RTP (Return To Player)

This endpoint allows users to simulate the RTP using multiple threads.

#### REST Endpoint

- **URL**: `/multiPlay`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "betAmount": 40.5,
    "playerNumber": 50,
    "numberOfRounds": 1000000,
    "numberOfThreads": 24
  }
  ```

#### WebSocket Endpoint

- **Destination**: `/app/multiPlay`
- **Broadcast Topic**: `/topic/multiPlay`

## Usage

#### Using REST API

1. To **place a bet**:
   - Send a POST request to `/play` with the appropriate `BetRequest` payload.
   - The server will process the bet and respond with a `BetResponse`.

2. To **simulate RTP**:
   - Send a POST request to `/multiPlay` with the `BetRequest` payload.
   - The server will process the simulation and respond with a `BetResponse`.


#### Using WebSocket
1. Using Browser client
   - Once the server is running, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to access the app's frontend. Here, you can start placing bets.

2. Using other web=socket client

   - Connect to the WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080/ws`).
   - Subscribe to the topic `/topic/play` or `/topic/multiPlay`. 
   - Whenever a bet is placed by any user (either through the REST API or WebSocket), all subscribed clients will receive the `BetResponse`.

### Error Handling

If there are any issues with the bet, such as an invalid bet amount or invalid number choice, an error message will be returned instead of the `BetResponse`.


## Testing

1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run the tests using the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
